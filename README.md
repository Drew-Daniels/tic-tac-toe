# Tic-Tac-Toe game for The Odin Project

### Improvements
* Color the 'Human' and 'AI' buttons green when selected (persist)
    * Will have to create js functions to do this
* Color the 'X' and 'O' buttons when selected (persist)
* Keep track of player scores as winners are declared
* Center the footer with where the board is
* Have the 'Restart' button restart the current match (including resetting the scoreboard)
* Have the footer not go on top of the board when the screen is scrunched to have a low-height
* Have the 'Scoreboard' section of the toolbar be parallel with the other toolbar sections (i.e., not all the way to the left)
